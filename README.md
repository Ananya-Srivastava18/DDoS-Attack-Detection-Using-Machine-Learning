Introduction
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyber-attack where multiple compromised systems are used to  flood a targeted  server, website, or  network with a large volume of traffic, requests  or data,  making it inaccessible to its legitimate users. In a DDoS attack, the attacker can take control of many computers or devices 
(also called botnets) that have been infected with malware. The attacker then uses these compromised systems to send an overwhelming amount of traffic or requests  to the target system, making it unable  to handle legitimate requests. DDoS attacks can have severe consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust. 
Detecting and mitigating these attacks is crucial to maintaining the integrity of networks and services. This project focuses on classifying DDoS attacks using various machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is the IDS 2017 dataset.
The project involves several key steps: data preprocessing, exploration, splitting, model training, evaluation, and comparison. Each step is crucial to building an effective DDoS detection model. We employ multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, to classify the attacks and evaluate their performance using various metrics.
